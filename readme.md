> Goal:
Find an **efficient** workflow for converted typed text into __personalized__ $handwriting$.

####Ideas 
1. Create an efficient way to generate a typable font from handwriting
   | Advantages | Drawbacks |
   | ------ | ----------- |
   | Simple   | The defined size of letters is unnatural |
   | ... |Fonts do not attach flow between letters |
   | ... | The final product may not be convincing |

2. Build an ANN which generates the handwriting
   | Advantages | Drawbacks |
   | ------ | ----------- |
   | SOTA models are impressive   | Incredibly technically challenging |
   | If done right, will be convincing | Training time can slow down the process |
   | Interesting | Large text may prove too slow to generate

####Universal Challenge
_Regardless of approach, streamlined input collection will be a challenge_

######Solutions:
+ Create a printable template which in conjunction with a scanner, creates either training data for the ANN or the font itself
