--- 
> Goal:
Find an **efficient** workflow for converted typed text into __personalized__ _handwriting_.

#### Setup

1. Generate a custom handwiring font
   - Caligriphr is what I used for the sample. Free accounts only support 75 character fonts, so you will have to make sacrifices (eliminate characters you won't use). Currently, fonts with alternate glyphs are not supported, so if you want variation for a particular character then you will have to sacrifice having a capital letter for that character (use capital slot as another lower case variation, this program will randomize capital and lower case for you).
2. Open graphite.py and customize the config variables
   - Be sure to upload your own background image (in place of graph.jpg)
   - Place your font file in the directory
3. Run graphite.py and observe the result in sample.png (or whatever path you changed it to)
